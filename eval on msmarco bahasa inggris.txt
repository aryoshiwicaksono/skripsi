2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Query : what is fortran programming language

2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Rank 1: 8255636 [] - Computer language or programming language is a coded syntax used by computer programmers to communicate with a computer. It is the only language that computers, software programs...

2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Rank 2: 5578167 [] - A dynamic programming language is a language which allows the definition of a program to be updated while the program is running.

2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Rank 3: 7577722 [] - Fortran (previously FORTRAN, derived from Formula Translating System) is a general-purpose, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.

2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Rank 4: 290488 [] - A few programmers write programs in the computer's own language called machine code. Most programs are written using a programming language like C++, Java, and Python. These programming languages are more like the language you talk and write with every day.

2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Rank 5: 1686443 [] - A scripting language or script language is a programming language that supports scripts, programs written for a special run-time environment that can interpret (rather than compile) and automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator.

2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Rank 6: 2005985 [] - A programming language is a formal computer language or constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.

2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Rank 7: 2521778 [] - A programming language is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.

2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Rank 8: 4362800 [] - That line of code is written in the Python programming language. Put simply, a programming (or coding) language is a set of syntax rules that define how code should be written and formatted. Thousands of different programming languages make it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites.

2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Rank 9: 5223240 [] - PHP is an interpreted script language which means that it is usually processed by an interpreter. For this reason, the language is most suitable for server-side programming that have server tasks being repeatedly performed when the website development process is on.

2024-12-30 13:18:03 - Rank 10: 5263553 [] - Forth is an imperative stack-based computer programming language and environment originally designed by Charles Chuck Moore.
